# HangMan-Game
This is a Simple Hangman Game written only in Python.
To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard.
If you guess incorrectly 6 times, you lose. 
If you guess the word before that happens, you win.
After you win or lose, you can restart the game by running the main.py file again.
